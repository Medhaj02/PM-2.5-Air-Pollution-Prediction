# PM-2.5-Air-Pollution-Prediction
Air Pollution PM2.5 Prediction Description The "Air Pollution PM2.5 Analysis and Prediction" initiative analyses and predicts fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in the air. PM2.5 is a major air pollutant made up of microscopic particles that can enter the respiratory system and cause health problems. This study intends to gather insights into PM2.5 concentration patterns and trends, identify variables influencing its levels, and construct a forecast model for future PM2.5 levels.

In this first we will perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
After processing and visualisation we will move towards model implementation which will be done by sklearn library.
After model implementation we will evaluate the models and see their performance and we will check that any model is overfitted.If any model is overfitted then we will apply cross validation or hyperparameter tuning to increase it's performance.

In this we use Ridge Regression and Random Forest Regressor for model building.
